8 Queens Problem PseudoCode


1. Display Program name, instructions and how to exit game. 
2. Display the empty board, prompt user to choose a column and a row.
3. Validate the (x, y) by checking column, row, and 4 diagonals against existing stack nodes. 
	If a node exists, do not push (x, y) on to stack. Display message that a queen is already there. 
	Else push node on stack and re-draw board, showing queen on board. 
4. Prompt user for next column, row. Repeat step 3. Continue until 8 successful guesses. 
5. After 8 successful guesses, show completed board. 
6. Always listen for an exit command on every input from user. 

Draw board by looping across 8 rows. 
For each row, print a string of '+---+'for 8 columns, then check stack for a queen on that row.
If there's a queen, add a ' Q |'
If there's no queen, add a '   |'

Check columns by looping over count of stackNode, check the inputted column against each column in the stack. 
Check rows the same way. 
Check each diagonal separately by passing in the input (x, y), loop over each (col, row) on board in each direction, 
then loop through each node in stack to see if the current (col, row) matches. if it matches, do not push node on stack. 
Starting with input (col, row), 
topLeft checks col-1, row-1
topRight checks col+1, row-1
bottomLeft checks col-1, row+1
bottomRight checks col+1, row+1
